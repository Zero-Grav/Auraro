#### Description
​	For not reinvent the wheel，I using the M. 2 interface to design a PCB. 

​	By using the  M. 2 interface you can  design many chips ' coreboard.Not only the STM32.

​	You are welcome to reappear and put forward your opinions. You are also welcome to launch different chip versions and backplanes with different functions.

#### Software Architecture

- KiCAD 6.0 [ PCB ]

- Blender 3.0 [ 3D  ]

#### Hardware Architecture

M. 2 / NGFF four models A, B, E, M, B + M.

It is recommended that the design comply with ngff specification, so as to realize the compatibility between boards.

NGFF specification documents: see the docs directory.

We support chips:

- STM32-F4 (All_Suppoort) -- NGFF_2230

- ESP-C3 -- NGFF_2230

  STM32-F4：

  ### Details

  If you have any questions , you can send email  1342762864@qq.com.

  ​	At this stage, because the two boards are just designed, they have not been fully tested. In order for each board to work perfectly, a complete test process will be developed, and then you can be submitted after passing the test.
